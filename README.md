**Created by Himanshu Shukla**

## Project Overview
Road safety is a global concern impacting countless communities. This project presents a comprehensive and interactive Excel Dashboard analyzing road accident data for 2021 and 2022. The dashboard equips stakeholders with actionable insights to drive data-informed decisions and foster safer roads.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Timelines, Hyperlinks)
- **Data Cleaning** (Duplicates removal, NULL handling, data consistency)
- **Data Transformation** (New attributes: Year, Month)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Data Analysis using Pivot Tables/Charts
- Filtering, Sorting, Conditional Functions
- Dashboard Design & Visualization

## Dashboard Requirements & KPIs
- **Primary KPIs:**
  - Total Casualties & Total Accidents (Current Year + YoY Growth)
  - Casualties by Accident Severity (Current Year + YoY Growth)
- **Secondary KPIs:**
  - Casualties by Vehicle Type (Current Year)
  - Monthly Casualty Trends (Year-on-Year)
  - Casualties by Road Type, Location, Day/Night (Current Year)
  - Total Casualties & Accidents by Location

##  Preparation
- **Cleaning Steps:**
  - Checked for NULLs, blanks, errors
  - Removed duplicates & irrelevant columns
  - Ensured consistent data types/formats
  - Added `Year` and `Month` columns for analysis

## Analysis Approach
- Created a **Data Analysis** sheet with 9 Pivot Tables to summarize:
- Casualty trends by type, vehicle, road, location, month, etc.
- Analyzed monthly trends for 2021 and 2022

## Dashboard Features
- Custom Pivot Charts for visual insights
- Interactive Slicers and Timelines for user-friendly filtering
- Hyperlinks for quick navigation

## Key Insights
- **Total Casualties:** 417,883 over two years
- **Peak Months:** October & November (highest casualties), January & February (lowest)
- **Vehicle Type:** Cars involved in ~80% of casualties
- **Accident Severity:** 84.1% slight, 1.7% fatal
- **Road Type:** Single Carriageway (most), Slip Road (least)
- **Road Surface:** 67% casualties on dry surfaces
- **Location:** 61% in urban areas
- **Light Conditions:** 73% in daylight

## Recommendations
- **Target High-Risk Months:** Focus road safety interventions in October and November
- **Car Driver Awareness:** Implement targeted campaigns and stricter monitoring
- **Single Carriageway Upgrades:** Improve/expand to double lanes where possible
- **Road Surface Maintenance:** Prioritize areas with poor surface conditions
- **Urban Safety Measures:** Enhance urban road safety, especially in daylight

## Conclusion
The Road Accident Analytics Dashboard empowers decision-makers with critical insights, supporting data-driven policies and interventions for safer roads.
